# Introduction

Chaterm is an AI native terminal built for infrastructure and cloud resource management. It enables engineers to use natural language to perform complex tasks such as deploying services, troubleshooting, and resolving problems.

With its built-in expert-level knowledge base and powerful proxy reasoning capabilities, Chatem understands your business topology and operational goals. No need to memorize complex commands, syntax, or parameters. simply describe your task objectives in natural language, and Chatem can autonomously plan and execute complex operations across multiple hosts or clusters, including key processes such as code building, service deployment, fault diagnosis, and automatic rollback.

Powered by long-term memory and team knowledge bases, Chaterm learns team knowledge and user habits. Its goal is to be your intelligent DevOps co-pilot, allowing engineers to complete daily tasks more efficiently through reusable agent skills. Chaterm aims to lower the cognitive barrier associated with different technology stacks, enabling every developer to quickly gain the operational experience and execution capabilities of a senior SRE.

## Why Choose Chaterm

Chaterm is not just a smarter terminal, it's an infrastructure agent.
There is a saying that every agent fails all the time, but Chaterm helps you fix it.

- 🤖 From commands to execution — describe tasks, let AI plan and run them

- 🌐 Built for real infrastructure — Servers, Kubernetes, and multi-cluster workflows

- 🔁 Reusable Agent Skills — turn experience into automation

- 🧠 Context-aware intelligence — understands your systems, not just commands

- 🛡️ Safe & controllable — auditable, reviewable, and rollback-ready

## Key Features

- 🤖 **AI Agent**

  The Agent understands the target, autonomously plans, and performs problem analysis and root cause localization across multiple hosts, automatically closing the loop to complete complex process handling.

  Device workflows continue from each command's actual result until an explicit completion or clarification. XML, DSML and Raven bridge tool calls share the same dispatch and approval rules. Invalid or truncated text tool calls request a bounded format repair; truncated commands are never executed.

  Every operation is auditable and traceable, and supports rapid log rollback, making AI automation more secure and reliable in production environments.

- 🧠 **Smart completion**

  Combining user habits, local memory, and the current server context, the Agent recommends the most suitable commands, making terminal input smarter and more efficient.

  Supports cross-device session synchronization and reduces mobile input costs through quick commands and voice interaction, making remote maintenance smoother.

- 🧩 **Knowledge Base**

  Supports importing technical manuals, internal documents, scripts, and white papers to build a personal maintenance knowledge system.

  Chaterm understands the current infrastructure context and accurately retrieves relevant knowledge to assist in task decision-making and execution.

- ⚡ **Agent Skill**

  Encapsulates complex maintenance processes into reusable AI skills, achieving structured and reliable automated execution.

  Help teams accumulate operational experience, enabling AI to be applied securely and stably in real production environments.

- 🔌 **Plugin System**

  Through plugin extensions, achieve unified authentication, dynamic authorization, and secure encrypted connections for public cloud servers and Kubernetes.

  Provide a more efficient resource access experience and facilitate centralized infrastructure management.
